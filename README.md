# Polyglot Gibbs Sampler
This is a fork of Darren Wilkinson's [blog post](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/gibbs-sampler-in-various-languages-revisited/) on Gibbs sampling in various languages. I'd like to try parallelization of existing implementations and new implementations in other languages.
